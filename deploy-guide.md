# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues Summary

✓ Fixed authentication endpoint bug (missing /api/auth/user route)
✓ Improved session management with proper store configuration  
✓ Fixed landing page button click handlers
✓ Created proper Vercel deployment configuration
✓ Added PostgreSQL database with all required tables
✓ Fixed Vercel config conflict between builds and functions properties

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables Required
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - A secure random string for sessions  
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

### 2. Build Configuration
The app uses the following build process:
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates `dist/index.js` which serves both frontend and API.

### 3. Database Setup
Ensure your PostgreSQL database is accessible from Vercel.
Run migrations: `npm run db:push`

## Deployment Steps

1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy with automatic builds enabled
4. Vercel will use the corrected vercel.json configuration

## Current Status

Your app is now ready for deployment. The authentication system works properly and you can log in using:
- Demo button for instant access
- Any email/password combination (creates user automatically)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure SESSION_SECRET is set
- Check database connectivity
- Verify cookie settings for production

### Build Failures  
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Check TypeScript compilation
- Verify all imports are correct

### Vercel Deployment
- The vercel.json now uses builds/routes configuration (no conflicts)
- Single Express server handles all routes including frontend
- Build output goes to dist/index.js
- Clean configuration without conflicting properties
